# Study of Animations with HTML5 Canvas and CSSOM

This project showcases the use of HTML5 Canvas along with CSSOM to create interactive visual effects and layered animations. We focus on creating a parallax effect with multiple layers that users can interact with by changing visual characteristics such as color, opacity, and other transformations.

## Features

- **Multi-Layer Animation**: Utilize HTML5 Canvas for complex, layered visual effects.
- **Dynamic Style Manipulation**: Interact with CSSOM to modify styles in real-time.
- **Interactive Controls**: Navigate through different animated layers with user input.
- **Diverse Animations**: Implement rotation, scaling, and opacity changes to enhance user engagement.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structures the page content and provides the canvas for rendering animations.
- **CSS3**: Styles the visual presentation and layout of the project.
- **JavaScript**: Drives the dynamic interactions and animations on the canvas, along with CSSOM for style manipulations.
